Machine Learning Project on "Human Text and Speech Analysis using CNN"
We, as humans, have different ways of expressing things. These feelings usually vary according to the circumstances. 
The different types of feelings usually expressed stages from anger, disgust, worry, happiness, unhappiness, and wonder. 
We can detect all these feelings and emotions from the sentences they use while they speak, i.e., from phrases or text. 
These emotions play a major role in day-to-day life because it depends on play human behavior and consumer interactions. 
We have the ability to investigate textual content and speech to understand feelings can result in advanced programs. 
This undertaking awareness on emotion popularity within the context of the text in addition to speech and any viable integration to make a better model for detection. 
We are taking into consideration the previous activities or researches that took place so as to create a model with better detection activities.
We have used a module technique that investigates speech and textual content, i.e., sentences one after the other, and detect emotional levels. 
To implement the stated module from input with special processing techniques for speech and textual information, a one-directional convolutional neural network(CNN) is used. 
We use datasets called IEMOCAP and REVDES to train and improve the quality of detection.
This task presently aims at distinguishing among seven exclusive forms of feelings which can be correctly carried out for hospital purposes in addition to assistive generation consisting of chatbots to offer a far extra natural and customized approach to a response.
